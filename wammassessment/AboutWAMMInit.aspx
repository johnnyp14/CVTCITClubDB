        <h2>What is the WAMM Initiative</h2>

        <P id="left">The WAMM Initiative is one part of the CVTC IT Club. It was formed to help the
        not for profit group <a href="http://www.westafricanmedicalmissions.org/">West African Medical Mission</a>
         (WAMM). We are developing an application to help the group track resources. 
         <br /><br />
         Our teacher advisor is Shawn Creviston. The group leaders are Bridget Sorenson and Christina Hitz. There
         are three teams within the group: Database, GUI, and Encryption.<br /> 
         I am the leader for the DB team, Bridget, and Lisa Smith work with me. Currently being the team leader 
         means that I get to write down the questions and forward them to Shawn and the group leaders. Otherwise we 
         work colaboratively to develop the DB.<br />
         Ben Anderson is the team leader for Encryption. He is teaching those who are interested more about it.<br />
         Eric Stephenson is the team leader for the GUI.<br /><br />
         The other teams have more members. I haven't had a chance to get to know them. As I learn who they are I 
         will add them into the list.</P>
