        <h2>Why I chose to make this site</h2>

        <P id="left">I spent several weeks trying to figure out what to do for a project. 
        Finally I decided to make this site based off the the CVTC IT Club project I am working on. 
        The site will not actually be on the internet. It is just to give the people requesting our 
        help an idea of what we are doing. Mostly it is to allow them to see the current Databse Schema
        and how it works. 
        <br /><br />
        The Database is the part of the project that my team is working on. Ultimately another team will 
        produce a GUI for use with the DB. Until their GUI is done this web application will let us work 
        with the DB and get a better idea of what we need.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="head">Phase 2</span><br />
        Phase 2 will continue to work on this site as part of the project. Allowing us to work on validation, 
        authentication, and query development. My goal in doing this is to have good knowledge of DB 
        development, ASP.NET, and VB.NET.
